# What is GitHub?

## Collaboration Tool

It has evolved to become a general project management tool with an emphasis on documenting how files change across many users' edits.

## Originally for Code

GitHub is based on [`git`](https://git-scm.com/).
Git is a distributed version control system.
That means that many people can work simultaneously on groups of connected documents, like source code.
The focus was on resolving conflicts that occur when programmers make incompotible changes while working in parallel.

## "Track Changes" on **STEROIDS**

Track changes is something that many people are familiar with from collaborating on documents in Word and Google Docs.
It helps keep track of things like:
- Who made changes
- What the changes were

Git adds things like:
- Comments to explain _why_ the changes were made
- Timestamps to track when the changes were made
- Formal tools for comparing and resolving conflicts in proposed changes.
