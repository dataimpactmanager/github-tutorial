# How Hard is it to Learn to Use GitHub?
It's ... not the easiest :(
## Specialized Terminology

There is a lot of jargon involved in using GitHub.
So much so that there is a [dedicated glossary page][glossary]
The jargon that I work with the most comes from the underlying [commands and concepts][git-commands] of `git`.
In theory, that can help you to remember which tool is useful for which task.
