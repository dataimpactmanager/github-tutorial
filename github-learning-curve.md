# How Hard is it to Learn to Use GitHub?
It's ... not the easiest :(

## Specialized Terminology

There is a lot of jargon involved in using GitHub.
So much so, in fact, that there is a [dedicated glossary page][glossary].
The jargon that I work with the most comes from the underlying [commands and concepts][git-commands] of `git`.
In theory, that can help you to remember which tool is useful for which task.

## Distinct Workflow

Another thing that people have to deal with when using GitHub is that it changes your workflow.
We all (I hope) are used to the idea of regularly saving our work, although cloud services like Google Workspace are eroding the necessity of this valuable habit.
GitHub introduces two extra stages in its [basic workflow][git-workflow]: merging different people's work and backing up local changes to a remote server.
In theory, these are also things that people must do, at least occasionally, and making them a regular part of our workflow makes our work (and our moral fiber!) more robust.

## Markdown Document Format

The other thing that may annoy people about GitHub is learning to write in the [Markdown document format][git-markdown].
Few sane people wake up in the morning and say "yay, I get to learn a new format for typing documents!"
Nevertheless, Markdown is awesome.
I am using it to throw together this whole tutorial/site/presentation in about an hour.
It took me less than an hour to get a basic grasp of its features.
