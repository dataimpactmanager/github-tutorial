# Why use GitHub?

## To Avoid Repeating Ourselves

There is a lot of potential for repeating ourselves in this job.
Hand-editing or collating spreadsheets, for example, can eat up HOURS.
Sharing tricks, methods, and even scripts can save us time.

### Coordinate Data Processing Tasks

There are many tools for automating tedious spreadsheet tasks.
Sharing these in a repository makes them easier to re-use for ourselves and others.

### Document Data Sources

Actual data is not a good thing to put on GitHub.
Links to data sources, however, are perfect for it.
Any scripts or notes about how to wrangle the data into a more-useable format can also go with those links.

### Track Efforts

GitHub tracks how often commits occur to a repository.
This is a good baseline for understanding project progress.
It can also help new folks, like me, to learn to budget time better.

### Collaborate Beyond Wisconsin

There are already several ...

- folks from the broader StriveTogether community who are interested in this kind of collaboration.
- non-StriveTogether projects that work on related problems, like wrangling data from the [US Census Bureau](@uscensusbureau).
